          <p>  I was born and raised in Philadelphia within a multicultural family,
           where three languages were spoken at home. I pursued my education and 
           lived in Barcelona for three years, gaining valuable international experience. 
           From a young age, I had the privilege of traveling around the world, attending
            the Olympic Games in Beijing, London, and Rio, and extensively exploring regions 
            in Central America and South Asia. Currently, I am furthering my academic pursuits 
            this semester in Australia. My passion lies in engaging with individuals from diverse
             cultural and social backgrounds, fostering a deep appreciation for global perspectives 
             and experiences.

            <p>  As a dedicated student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at 
          Northeastern University, I am deeply enthusiastic about programming and robotics.
           My approach to learning is inherently hands-on and practical, fueling my eagerness
            to actively participate in projects that involve programming, hands-on activities,
             and assembly work. </p>
