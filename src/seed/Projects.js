        for Week-Book in Boston, MA. Leveraging the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture \

         Events and Tasks separately, aided by advanced features like task completion status tracking,\
          multiple themes, and versatile sorting and search capabilities. My contributions extended to\
           developing robust file I/O functionality for data persistence and conducting rigorous testing\
            to ensure the application's unwavering reliability and stability.",

          the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, and Object-Oriented Design \
          (OOD) principles. My work extended to implementing an advanced AI shot-guessing algorithm, \
          enhancing the AI opponent's strategic capabilities based on heuristic analysis of prior successful \
          shots and misses. This project showcased my expertise in software development and problem-solving, \
          demonstrating proficiency in CLI-based gaming and AI strategy. As a class project, this was later\
           developed into just an ai playing against server ai. The class held a tournament for all the ai's to battle eachother. ",
